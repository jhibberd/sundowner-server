* Before testing a user's access token needs to be added to the environment
  variables section in JMeter.

* The Content/GET endpoint is the bottleneck of the API and can sustain a rate
  of 30 rps with an average response time of 500ms.

  Without using the MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline this endpoint could sustain
  almost 70 rps but the algorithm was not as sophisticated.

  The various algorithm batch sizes greatly influence the performance of this
  endpoint.
